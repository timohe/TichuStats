## About the app
#### I cannot add other players to my game
This can have three reasons:
1) the player you want to add did not register yet → please tell him/her to do so
2) the player did not put your name on his friend list yet→ please tell him/her to do so in the settings tab (only people you have on your friend list can add you to their games)
3) the player you want to add has an unfinished (other) game → he/she need to finish/delete this to be able to participate in a new one

#### How are the statistics calculated?
You can tap on the tiles with the value and they will flip, revealing their secret.

#### How is my rank calculated?
The calculation for your rank is based on an ELO system. The app first sums up the ranks of the two players in each team and then compares these values to each other. The higher the difference between these two sums, the higher the stakes for this game. The winning players gain as much ELO points as the defeated players lose.

#### I just finished a game, but neighter my rank nor my stats have changed. Why?
Only finished games with four registered players count for your rank and your stats. As soon as a game includes one or several guests, the game is not taken into account.


#### Why are my statistics not ranked?
To get fairly reliable values, we do not rank your statistics until you have played 100 rounds (equals approximately 10 games). However, your rate of successful Tichus will always remain unranked, because we do not want to reward players for only calling with outstanding hands.

#### One of my stats changed colour, is that normal?
Congratulations, this means you occupy a podium position in this stat at the moment! Tiles turn gold if you are within the top 5%, silver for top 10% and bronze for everybody with a top 20% value. Make sure you do not lose it!

#### Can we continue the game if the battery of my phone is dead?
Yes you can. Simply beg one of the other players to log in into his/her account or use a different phone with your personal login. All players have access to the games they are playing in.

#### I got a game in my history which I did not play
That is unfortunate, you might consider revising your friend list :-) Please swipe left in the history (first tab) to request a deletion. We will then contact you via email.

#### My statistics are not showing the correct value
If you have reason to believe that your statistics show an incorrect value, please contact [tichustats@gmail.com](mailto:tichustats@gmail.com) with a short explanation and your username, we are happy to look into it.
