### Who is behind Tichustatistics?
Tichustatistics was an idea of Christian Maurer. Design and app by Timo Hegnauer.

### I have an idea for the app.
Please contact tichustatistics@gmail.com. We are always happy for ideas and feedback. Keep in mind the app is developed by one person completely in his free time so things can take a bit longer.

### I got a game in my history which I did not play
Please swipe left in the history to request a deletion. We will then contact you via email.

### What is happening with my data?
We only have your email address and we only use this to send you necessary emails (e.g. password reset). In the future we also may have some kind of newsletter. We will not pass your email to any third party.

We don't. At the moment we lose money as we have to pay our IT infrastructure. In the future we will try to cover this via donations at bigger tournaments. If you want to contribute directly, please write to  tichustatistics@gmail.com

### Can you also translate this app to X?
We are happy to include other languages. If you want to contribute, contact tichustatistics@gmail.com an
